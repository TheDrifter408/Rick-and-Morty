## About
### Rick And Morty API:
This project uses the [rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#graphql) graphQL and tailwind to design a website with realtime filtering.

### MotionOne:
The MotionOne library [motion.dev](https://https://motion.dev/) was used for the sliding in animations. This was preferred over framer motion due to its smaller bundle size.

### GraphQL Codegen:
This package was used to generate query types for the data being request and `graphql-request` was used as a plugin to write the queries, `graphql` and `request` them, these two are functions available from graphql-request package.
